Manifest

Attempt at the definitive manifest implementation. 

                                 -*-

A more user-oriented version of ExtUtils::Manifest.  In addition to
creating a file listing, also records checksums for each file.  Three
reports are built-in to the command line interface:

MISSING - Lists files that were in the old manifest but are missing
          from the new manifest.

DIFF    - Splits output into a listing of files that were add, removed,
          and modified.  Output is similar to a context diff.

OVERLAP - Reports which files are in both trees.

                                 -*-
