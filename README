Manifest

Attempt at the definitive manifest implementations. 

                                 -*-

File::Manifest - A more user oriented version of ExtUtils::Manifest.
Supports multiple checksum algorithms with built-in support for MD5,
cksum, and sum.

Command line program manifest provides an interface to the library.

Hopefully, this package will eventually be rolled into a File::*
bundle.

                                 -*-

Requires File::Recurse (part of File::Tools module).
